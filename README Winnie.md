This database is a personal relational database built in SQLite using DB Browser. It contains three tables: **BasicInfo** (personal details such as name, age, hometown, and email), **Education** (academic background including school, degree, and graduation year), and **Interests** (hobbies and skills with attributes for hobby, skill level, and category). The **Education** and **Interests** tables are linked to **BasicInfo** through foreign keys (FK) referencing *basicinfo.id,* ensuring relational integrity. Each table has five records and is defined with appropriate primary keys (PK). An accompanying ER diagram illustrates the structure and relationships among the tables.
