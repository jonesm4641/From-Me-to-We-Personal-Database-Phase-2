Team Roles & Responsibilities


1. Project Management – Marc-Anthony Jones, Winnie, Argenis

Oversees the entire project timeline and deliverables.

Makes sure the team stays on track and meets deadlines.

Coordinates between roles (designers, migrator, QA, documentation).

Final decision maker if conflicts arise about schema or approach.

Ensures the final package (SQL dump, ERD, README) is complete and consistent.


2. Schema Designers – Amarlin & Miriangie

Analyze all individual Phase 1 databases.

Design the unified Phase 2 schema (which we just created).

Ensure normalization (no duplicates, consistent naming).

Create or refine the ER Diagram that represents the team schema.

Work closely with Data Migrator (Ashlynn) to ensure the schema supports the data.

Prepares the final ERD diagram file to be submitted.


3. Data Migrator – Ashlynn Jackson 
Responsible for moving data from each person’s Phase 1 database into the unified schema.

Writes and runs the INSERT scripts that populate the new tables.

Handles transformation (adapting old table structures to fit the new schema).

Ensures foreign keys link correctly (e.g., education → person + institution).

Works closely with Schema Designers and QA to troubleshoot insertion issues.


4. QA Testers – Larry, Lisbeth, & Monet

Test the unified database once data is inserted.

Run queries to check:

Primary/foreign key relationships are intact.

No missing or duplicate records.

Data looks correct (e.g., emails are valid, grad years are accurate).

Stress-test queries (joins across multiple tables).

Report bugs or issues back to the team for fixes.


5. Documentation Lead – Jeremi Samuel

Creates the README for the final project.

Documents:

How the unified schema was designed.

Mapping decisions (why certain columns were merged or renamed).

Challenges faced and how the team solved them.

Roles and contributions of each member.

Ensures everything is written clearly for professor review.

6. Unassigned – Monet & Winnie

Currently not assigned specific tasks in the updated file.

Possible roles they can take on (depending on team agreement):

Support Migrator → help Ashlynn with data inserts.

Extra QA → help Larry & Lisbeth run validation queries.

Research/Presentation Support → help Jeremi polish documentation and ERD.
